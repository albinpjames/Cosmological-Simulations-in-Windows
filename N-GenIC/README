*************************************************************

This code can be used to create initial conditions for N-body
simulations of cosmological structure formation, within the standard
LCDM paradigm. Optionally the code can also create additional SPH
particles for mixed dark matter/gas simulations.  The code is an MPI
code and can be used to setup fairly large initial conditions if
desired. The output format is that of the GADGET code, in its basic
file format 1.

To use the code, first adjust the Makefile as needed. Like GADGET, the
code needs a correctly compiled FFTW-2 version with MPI support. You
also need the Gnu Scientific library (GSL). In the Makefile, you can
set/unset the following compile time options:

PRODUCEGAS - use this if you want the code to automatically produce
interleaved pairs of particles for dark matter and SPH particles. The
relative masses of the gas and the dark will be inferred from the
cosmological parameters you set in the code's parameterfile.

NO64BITID - activate this if ordinary 32-bit integers are sufficient
to store unique particle IDs. You only need to unset this and use
64-bit long integer IDs if the total particle number exceeds 2^32 ~ 4
billion.

CORRECT_CIC - this determines whether or not the effect of CIC
interpolation should be deconvolved when interpolating the
displacement field from the FFT-grid to the actual particle
positions. If you use a Cartesian grid of particles for the
unperturbed particle load, then it's best to leave this off and use a
Fourier grid size that exactly matches the particle grid
dimension. Then there is no interpolation error at all. If you use a
glass particle load instead, the power close to the Nyquist frequency
will be more accurately represented if you set this option.

Once you sucessfully compiled the code, you then create ICs by calling
the code, for example,  with a command of the form:

  mpiexec -np 8  ./N-GenIC  ics.param

This would launch the code using 8 MPI tasks. The parameterfile
"ics.param" has a similar structure to GADGET parameterfiles, and
describes the ICs. 

Please consult the enclosed example parameterfile "ics.param" for
comments about the meaning of the different parameters in this file.

Best regards,
